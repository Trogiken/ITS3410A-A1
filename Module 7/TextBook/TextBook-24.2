24.2 Launch the Application Associated with a Document
Problem
You want to launch the application associated with a document or with another shell association.

Solution
Use the Start-Process cmdlet (or its start alias) to launch the document or location:

PS > Start-Process https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/
PS > start https://www.bing.com
PS > start c:\temp\output.csv
To launch one of the predefined actions for a document (usually exposed through its right-click menu), use the -Verb parameter:

start c:\documents\MyDoc.docx -Verb Print
Discussion
The Start-Process cmdlet gives you a great deal of flexibility over how you launch an application. In addition to launching applications, it also gives you access to Windows shell associations: functionality associated with URLs and documents.

Windows defines many shell associations: for HTTP websites, FTP locations, and even Explorer-specific behavior. For example, to launch the All Tasks view of the Windows control panel:

start 'shell:::{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}'
If the document you’re launching defines an action (such as Edit or Print), you can use the -Verb parameter to invoke that action.

For more information about the Start-Process cmdlet and launching system processes, see Recipe 24.3.
