25.2 Manage a Running Service
Problem
You want to manage a running service.

Solution
To stop a service, use the Stop-Service cmdlet:

PS > Stop-Service AudioSrv -WhatIf
What if: Performing operation "Stop-Service" on Target "Windows Audio
(AudioSrv)".
Likewise, use the Suspend-Service, Restart-Service, and Resume-Service cmdlets to suspend, restart, and resume services, respectively.

Discussion
The Stop-Service cmdlet lets you stop a service either by name or display name.

For more information about the Stop-Service cmdlet, type Get-Help Stop-Service. If you want to suspend, restart, or resume a service, see the help for the Suspend-Service, Restart-Service, and Resume-Service cmdlets, respectively.

NOTE
Notice that the Solution uses the -WhatIf flag on the Stop-Service cmdlet. This parameter lets you see what would happen if you were to run the command but doesn’t actually perform the action.

To configure a service (for example, its description or startup type), see Recipe 25.3. In addition to letting you configure a service, the Set-Service cmdlet described in that recipe also lets you stop a service on a remote computer.
