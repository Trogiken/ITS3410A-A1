23.1 List All Event Logs
Problem
You want to determine which event logs exist on a system.

Solution
Use the Get-WinEvent cmdlet. In addition to classic event logs, the Get-WinEvent cmdlet supports Application and Services event logs:

PS > Get-WinEvent -ListLog * | Select LogName,RecordCount

LogName                                                        RecordCount

To browse event logs using the Windows Event Viewer graphical user interface, use the Show-EventLog cmdlet.

Discussion
The -List parameter of the Get-WinEvent cmdlet generates a list of the event logs registered on the system. In addition to supporting event logs on the current system, it also lets you supply the -ComputerName parameter to interact with event logs on a remote system.

Once you’ve determined which event log you’re interested in, you can use the Get-WinEvent cmdlet to search, filter, and retrieve specific entries from those logs. For information on how to retrieve event log entries, see Recipes 23.2, 23.3, and 23.4.

For more information about the Get-WinEvent cmdlet, type Get-Help Get-WinEvent.
